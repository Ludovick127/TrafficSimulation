# TrafficSimulation

Basic traffic simulation with simple rules.

## Overview

This project simulates traffic with cars moving along predefined routes. The simulation is visualized using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing. Each car has properties such as position, speed, and color, and follows simple rules to adjust its speed based on the distance to the next car.

## Features

- Simulates traffic with multiple cars.
- Cars adjust their speed based on the distance to the next car.
- Visual representation of the traffic simulation using Java Swing.
- Logging using Log4j2 for debugging and monitoring.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Gradle

## Build and Run
